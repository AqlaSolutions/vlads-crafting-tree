This mod is aimed to show a crafting tree for all ingredients with their amounts required to make a selected item.

1.    It also adds a button to the top of the screen where you can drop items to find out how to get them and where to spend them. Click with an empty hand to open a drop-down menu for fluids.
2.    There also is a shortcut (Ctrl+f by default) to search the current item in your hand or open a search bar when your hand is empty.
3.    The main window shows all the ingredients (with their crafting tree) and products, as well as the machines that can be used for crafting it. Click on items in the recipe pane to investigate further.
4.    You can pin or minimize a currently selected recipe to the left side of screen.

The "R:" in crafting tree means that there are multiple recipes from which you can choose to make the parent item. The text after "R:" is a such recipe name.
